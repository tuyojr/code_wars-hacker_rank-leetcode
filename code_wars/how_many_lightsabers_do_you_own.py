# Inspired by the development team at Vooza, write the function that

# accepts the name of a programmer, and
# returns the number of lightsabers owned by that person.
# The only person who owns lightsabers is Zach, by the way. He owns 18, which is
# an awesome number of lightsabers. Anyone else owns 0.

# Note: your function should have a default parameter.

# For example(Input --> Output):

# "anyone else" --> 0
# "Zach" --> 18



# import codewars_test as test
# from solution import how_many_light_sabers_do_you_own

# @test.describe("Fixed Tests")
# def fixed_tests():
#     @test.it('Basic Test Cases')
#     def basic_test_cases():
#         test.assert_equals(how_many_light_sabers_do_you_own("Zach"), 18)
#         test.assert_equals(how_many_light_sabers_do_you_own(), 0)
#         test.assert_equals(how_many_light_sabers_do_you_own("zach"), 0)
