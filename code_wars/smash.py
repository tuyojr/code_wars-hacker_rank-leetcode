# Sentence Smash
# Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together 
# into a sentence and returns the sentence. You can ignore any need to 
# sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between 
# each word. Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or 
# the end of the sentence!

# Example
# ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great']  =>  'hello world this is great'
