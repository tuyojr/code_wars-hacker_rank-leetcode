# Complete the solution so that the function will break up camel casing, 
# using a space between words.

# Example
# "camelCasing"  =>  "camel Casing"
# "identifier"   =>  "identifier"
# ""             =>  ""



# test.assert_equals(solution("helloWorld"), "hello World")
# test.assert_equals(solution("camelCase"), "camel Case")
# test.assert_equals(solution("breakCamelCase"), "break Camel Case")
