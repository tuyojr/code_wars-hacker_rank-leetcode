# You were camping with your friends far away from home, but when 
# it's time to go back, you realize that your fuel is running out 
# and the nearest pump is 50 miles away! You know that on average, 
# your car runs on about 25 miles per gallon. There are 2 gallons 
# left.

# Considering these factors, write a function that tells you if it 
# is possible to get to the pump or not.

# Function should return true if it is possible and false if not.
