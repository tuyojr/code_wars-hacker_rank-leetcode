# Implement a function that adds two numbers together and returns 
# their sum in binary. The conversion can be done before, or after 
# the addition.

# The binary number returned should be a string.

# Examples:(Input1, Input2 --> Output (explanation)))

# 1, 1 --> "10" (1 + 1 = 2 in decimal or 10 in binary)
# 5, 9 --> "1110" (5 + 9 = 14 in decimal or 1110 in binary)
