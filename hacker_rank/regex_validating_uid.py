# ABCXYZ company has up to 100 employees.
# The company decides to create a unique identification number 
# (UID) for each of its employees.
# The company has assigned you the task of validating all the 
# randomly generated UIDs.

# A valid UID must follow the rules below:

# It must contain at least 2 uppercase English alphabet characters.
# It must contain at least 3 digits (0 - 9).
# It should only contain alphanumeric characters (a - z, A - Z & 0 - 9).
# No character should repeat.
# There must be exactly 10 characters in a valid UID.

# Input Format

# The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.
# The next T lines contains an employee's UID.

# Output Format

# For each test case, print 'Valid' if the UID is valid. Otherwise, 
# print 'Invalid', on separate lines. Do not print the quotation marks.

# Sample Input

# 2
# B1CD102354
# B1CDEF2354

# Sample Output

# Invalid
# Valid

# Explanation

# B1CD102354: 1 is repeating â†’ Invalid
# B1CDEF2354: Valid

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
